# A new loss function for Ordinal Classification

This is the GitHub repository for the paper on a new loss function for ordinal classification.

## Datasets 

The experiments were done on 4 public datasets : 
* **SNLI** (Stanford Natural Language Inference): The Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus (version 1.0) is a collection of 570k human-written English sentence pairs manually labeled for balanced classification with the labels entailment, contradiction, and neutral. We aim for it to serve both as a benchmark for evaluating representational systems for text, especially including those induced by representation-learning methods, as well as a resource for developing NLP models of any kind. (source : https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/)
* **SST-5** : Sentiment classification of sentences extracted from movie reviews. Each sentence is labelled as either negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive or positive.  (source : https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/)
* **Amazon Reviews** : Sentiment classification of customer reviews on the Amazon website. Each sentence is labelled as either negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive or positive.  (source : https://registry.opendata.aws/amazon-reviews-ml/)
***Yelp Reviews** : Sentiment classification of sentences extracted from the Yelp website. Each sentence is labelled as either negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive or positive.  (source : https://www.yelp.com/dataset)
